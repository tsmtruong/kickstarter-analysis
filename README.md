# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

##Overview
This is an analysis on kickstarter data to discover trends and success rates of productions done by Louise to determine the best time to start a kickstarter, and the type kickstarter with the highest chances of success. The analysis is made to help Louise determine when to launch a kickstarter for a play that she is wanting to produce. With the use of Excel codes and the information Louie provided on past Kickstarters I was able to produce the best possible timeframes for Louise.
